1. What is React, and what problem does it solve compared to traditional DOM manipulation?
React is a JavaScript library used to build fast, interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.

Problem with traditional DOM manipulation:
Direct DOM updates are slow
Developers manually update UI in many places
Code becomes hard to maintain as apps grow

How React solves this:

Uses a component-based architecture
Uses a Virtual DOM to minimize real DOM updates
UI automatically updates when state changes

👉 React makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more predictable.

2. What is JSX in React, and how is it different from regular HTML?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;

| Feature     | JSX                    | HTML              |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Used in     | JavaScript             | Browser           |
| Attributes  | `className`, `htmlFor` | `class`, `for`    |
| Expressions | `{}` allowed           | Not allowed       |
| Compilation | Transpiled by Babel    | Directly rendered |

Example:-
<h1>{userName}</h1>


3. What is the difference between props and state in React? Give examples.
Props:-
Short for properties
Passed from parent to child
Read-only (cannot be changed)

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello {props.name}</h1>;
}

State:-
Holds component’s own data
Can be changed
Causes re-render when updated

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

| Feature       | Props         | State            |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Mutability    | Immutable     | Mutable          |
| Controlled by | Parent        | Component itself |
| Purpose       | Configuration | Dynamic data     |


4. What is the Virtual DOM, and how does React use it to update the UI efficiently?
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript copy of the real DOM.

How it works:
React creates a Virtual DOM tree
When state changes, a new Virtual DOM is created
React compares old vs new (diffing)
Only the changed elements are updated in the real DOM

👉 This process is called reconciliation, and it makes React fast and efficient.

5. What is a component in React, and what are the main types of components?
A component is a reusable, independent UI block in React.

Types of Components:
1️⃣ Functional Components (Most Used)
function Header() {
  return <h1>Welcome</h1>;
}
Simple
Uses Hooks
Preferred in modern React

2️⃣ Class Components

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Welcome</h1>;
  }
}

Uses lifecycle methods
Mostly used in legacy code
