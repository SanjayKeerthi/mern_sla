1. What is Closure? Give a real-life use case.
    Closure means a function remembers variables from its outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
   
   function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const increment = counter();
increment(); // 1
increment(); // 2

2. What happens if we don’t use break in switch?
    If break is not used, execution falls through to the next case.
 
 let x = 2;
switch (x) {
  case 1:
    console.log("One");
  case 2:
    console.log("Two");
  case 3:
    console.log("Three");
}

3. | null                   | undefined                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Assigned intentionally | Default value                      |
| Means "no value"       | Variable declared but not assigned |
| `typeof` → object      | `typeof` → undefined               |

4. What is Prototype in JavaScript?
    Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which allows property & method sharing.

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hi");
};

5.  Why was ES6 introduced?

ES6 was introduced to:

Make JS cleaner & modern

Support large applications

Improve readability

Add features like:

Arrow functions

Classes

Modules

Promises

6. | ES5        | ES6            |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| `var`      | `let`, `const` |
| Callbacks  | Promises       |
| No classes | Classes        |
| Verbose    | Cleaner syntax |

7. Explain Block Scope with example
    let and const are block-scoped.

    {
  let x = 10;
}
// x is NOT accessible here

8. What is Arrow Function & difference from normal function?
Arrow Function:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

| Arrow               | Normal        |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| No `this`           | Has `this`    |
| Short syntax        | Verbose       |
| No arguments object | Has arguments |

9. Why arrow functions don’t have their own this?

Arrow functions inherit this from parent scope, preventing confusion in callbacks.

Used heavily in React event handlers.

10. What are Template Literals?

Used for string interpolation and multiline strings.

const name = "Sanjay";
console.log(`Hello ${name}`);

11. What is Destructuring?

Extract values from arrays or objects.

Object Destructuring:
const user = { name: "A", age: 20 };
const { name, age } = user;

12. Convert ES5 function to ES6
ES5:
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

ES6:
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

13. Swap two numbers without third variable
let a = 10, b = 20;

[a, b] = [b, a];

14. Synchronous vs Asynchronous JS
Sync	            Async
Blocks execution	Non-blocking
One task at a time	Multiple tasks
Slow UI	Smooth UI

15. What is a Promise?

A Promise represents future completion or failure of an async task.

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})

16. Promise States

Pending

Fulfilled

Rejected

17. Callback vs Promise
Callback	    Promise
Callback hell	Clean chaining
Hard error handling	.catch()
Old approach	Modern

18. What is async/await?

Cleaner way to write async code.

async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetch(url);
}

19. What is async/await?

Cleaner way to write async code.

async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetch(url);
}

20. What happens if promise rejection is not handled?

Causes Unhandled Promise Rejection

App may crash or behave unpredictably

21. Optional Chaining (?.)

Prevents errors when accessing deep properties.

user?.address?.city

22. Nullish Coalescing (??)

Returns right value only if left is null or undefined.

let x = null ?? "default"; // default

23. Difference between || and ??

| || | ?? |
|----|----|
| Checks falsy values | Checks null/undefined only |
| 0 is false | 0 is valid |

24. What is Event Loop?

Manages async operations in JavaScript.

Executes call stack

Moves async tasks to queues

25. | Microtask       | Callback       |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Promises        | setTimeout     |
| Higher priority | Lower priority |

26. What is setTimeout? Is it async?

setTimeout schedules code after delay.

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello");
}, 1000);


 Yes, it is asynchronous.
